# AlgorethmsAndDataStructure
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system, while an algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output. Together, data structures and algorithms combine and allow programmers to build whatever computer programs theyâ€™d like. Deep study into data structures and algorithms ensures well-optimized and efficient code.
